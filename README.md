GUIDELINES FOR THE DIGITAL MARKETING DATASCIENCE PROJECT:
The purpose of the project is to present a data-driven communication strategy based on machine learning models. You should think at the project in these terms: You are a data scientist in a retail company. The marketing team wants to increase the return from the digital marketing investments. To do so the Chief of Marketing asks you about those data-driven approaches everybody is talking about. The idea is to address the churning of high-valuable customers.
- The project consists in  
1. a brief business-oriented presentation (10-15 slides) of the logic developed  
2. An explanation of the business questions approached  
3. A brief overview of the preliminary analyses performed  
4. The models chosen, the modelling structures and the algorithm performances  
5. Examples of data-driven actions that can be taken using the models  
6. the R script used for the modelling  
7. The code submitted must run correctly, be replicable and contain a clear and commented exposition of each pipeline step  
8. The code must include the commands for loading the necessary packages  
9. The pseudorandom generator must be fixed within the script using set.seed(12345)  
10. Together with the script, it must be provided a .txt file contained the info on the R session for testing the replicability obtained using the function sessionInfo()  
- The project is done individually  
- The datasets necessary for the project are available on google drive and are explored during the lectures    
Part1 https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gPiKUzRUHLbXLiWe2Fe6O91V86ZE2WMX    
Part2 https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MTrcTzndYhuUOFtaDNk-jWC8UmGdbo3V    
- The students are required to complete the R script for the RFM and CHURN model development started during the lessons and to add some personal perspective in the presentation.
- The final marking is based on:  
1. Correct and well-structured R code  
2. Right balance of presenting quantitative results avoiding unnecessary technicalities  
3. Clear identification of the key-points of the business questions  
4. Personal interpretation of the preliminary analyses  
5. Original ideas for data-driven actions  
6. A creative presentation layout  
A work that covers brilliantly these key points is entitled for the maximum mark  
- Optionally a student can develop autonomously one of the following models:  
1. Simulation modelling: Buy Till You Die (reference https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BTYD/vignettes/BTYD-walkthrough.pdf  
2. Time series modelling: Purchase Trends Forecast (reference https://otexts.com/fpp2/arima-r.html)  
3. Probabilistic modelling: Market Basket Analysis for the 100 most purchased items (reference https://datascienceplus.com/a-gentle-introduction-on-market-basket-    analysis%E2%80%8A-%E2%80%8Aassociation-rules/)  
Completing an additional model will be considered for extra points in the final marking.
